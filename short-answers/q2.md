# Answer

We need labels for every input in order to make the website accesible for everyone. The two ways to associate a label with an input is with the `aria=label/aria-labelledby` attribute and `label` element. The `aria-label/aria-labelledby` attribute is used to describe what is the purpose of the form. The `label` element is used to describe the purpose of the `input` element.
