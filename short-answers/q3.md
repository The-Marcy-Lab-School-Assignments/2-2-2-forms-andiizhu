<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

When clicking on the button created in line 6, because there is no type defined - it will be defaulted to have a `type="submit"`. When clicked it will submit the form.

When clicking on the button created in line 7, the default behavior is to submite the form.

When clicking on the button created in line 8,
the form will be reset all input fields to their default values.
